                <p><strong>Point Me There</strong> is a mobile app (created in HTML5 and converted using Phonegap) to point you directly to a location using GPS only. It is ideal for navigating abroad when you want to avoid data usage, for country walks when you can't get any signal, or anywhere where maps may not be the best solution.</p>

                <p>When I first started at everlution, their website was pretty basic and they didn't really have a brand or styleguide. I came up with a bunch of logo proposals, stationery and new website designs, and the favourites got spliced into everlution's new brand. The website was also built by me, though since it was before the 'javascript uprising', it was built with PHP partials (please don't judge!)</p>

                <p>Every now and again, Everlution would require me to create a poster and some fliers for an upcoming event. I loved these breaks from everyday work, as they were a nice chance to flex the creative muscles and make something cool. Here are a few samples!</p>
